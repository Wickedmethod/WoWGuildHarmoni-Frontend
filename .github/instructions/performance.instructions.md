## Performance Guidelines

### General Principles
- Measure before optimizing; use profiling tools to find bottlenecks
- Optimize for the common case; handle edge cases gracefully
- Cache expensive computations; invalidate caches appropriately

### Web Performance
- Minimize bundle sizes; use code splitting for large applications
- Optimize images and assets; use CDNs for static content
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Use service workers for caching strategies

### Backend Performance
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Use async/await for I/O operations; avoid blocking calls
