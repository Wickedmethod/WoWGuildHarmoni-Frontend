## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and workflows
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user journeys and business scenarios

### Test Quality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies; test one thing at a time
- Aim for high coverage on critical paths; don't chase 100% everywhere

### Test Maintenance
- Keep tests simple and focused; avoid complex setup
- Use test utilities and factories for common data
- Update tests when requirements change; don't just make them pass
