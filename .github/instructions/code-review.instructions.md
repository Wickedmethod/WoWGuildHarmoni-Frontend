## Code Review Guidelines

### Review Focus Areas
- **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- **Clarity**: Is the code easy to understand and maintain?
- **Performance**: Are there obvious bottlenecks or inefficiencies?
- **Security**: Are there potential vulnerabilities or data leaks?

### Review Process
- Keep changes small and focused; large PRs are harder to review
- Provide constructive feedback; explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Use linting/formatting tools to avoid style debates during review
