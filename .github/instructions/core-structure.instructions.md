## Project Structure & Organization

### File Organization
- Group by feature/domain, not by file type
- Keep related files close; separate concerns into focused modules
- Use consistent naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for types/classes

### Module Dependencies
- Prefer explicit imports/exports; avoid deep nesting
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) sparingly; prefer direct imports for clarity
- Keep circular dependencies minimal; extract shared abstractions if needed
