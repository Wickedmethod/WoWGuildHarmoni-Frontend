## Architecture Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: One reason to change per module
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interface methods
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Design for Change
- Prefer composition over inheritance; use dependency injection for flexibility
- Keep interfaces small and focused; avoid "god" interfaces
- Extract configuration from code; use environment variables and config files
